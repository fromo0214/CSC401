1.In the terminal or command prompt in whatever IDE you are using, run the command "javac "DirectoryTree.java"", which will then add .class files in whatever directory 
you have them in.

2. After it successfully compiles, you then input another command in the terminal which will be "java DirectoryTree "C:\Users\name\Desktop". The path path will be different on your 
computer so you must change the location of the path to your files. 

3. Once you input that command it will display the root directory and subdirectories, if it does not find a directory it will give you a message in the terminal that it is either not found or invalid.


Example, this is the command I use on my terminal to run the program and display the directories. 
java DirectoryTree C:\Users\fromo\OneDrive\Desktop\Root_Directory
